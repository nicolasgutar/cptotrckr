  "bitcoin.history.title": "History of Bitcoin",
  "bitcoin.history.text1": "Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper, which described a 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system' that would allow people to send and receive payments without relying on a central authority like a bank.",
  "bitcoin.history.text2": "In 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software, and the Bitcoin network came to life. The first 'block,' or record, was mined by Nakamoto, known as the Genesis Block. Since then, Bitcoin has gained popularity and is now widely recognized as the first successful cryptocurrency, inspiring thousands of other cryptocurrencies.",
  "bitcoin.howItWorks.title": "How Bitcoin Works",
  "bitcoin.howItWorks.text1": "Bitcoin is powered by blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Bitcoin transactions are verified by 'miners' through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate and secure transactions. This system prevents double-spending and ensures trust without needing a central authority.",
  "bitcoin.howItWorks.text2": "Bitcoin is also capped at 21 million coins, meaning no more bitcoins can be created beyond that limit. This fixed supply is part of what gives Bitcoin its value, as it contrasts with fiat currencies, which governments can print at will.",

  "ethereum.history.title": "History of Ethereum",
  "ethereum.history.text1": "Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin as a blockchain platform with a wider scope than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was created primarily as a digital currency, Ethereum was designed to serve as a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy applications (smart contracts) on top of its blockchain.",
  "ethereum.history.text2": "In 2015, Ethereum launched its main network, enabling the first smart contracts to be created and executed on the blockchain. Ethereum quickly gained traction and became the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, driving the development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).",
  "ethereum.howItWorks.title": "How Ethereum Works",
  "ethereum.howItWorks.text1": "Ethereum is powered by a decentralized network of computers running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which executes smart contracts. These smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement, enabling applications without a central authority.",
  "ethereum.howItWorks.text2": "Ethereum has also transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This switch aims to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and increase the network’s overall efficiency.",
