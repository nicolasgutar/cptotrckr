                        Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin as a blockchain platform with a wider scope
                        than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was created primarily as a digital currency, Ethereum was designed to serve
                        as a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy applications (smart contracts)
                        on top of its blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        In 2015, Ethereum launched its main network, enabling the first smart contracts to be created and executed
                        on the blockchain. Ethereum quickly gained traction and became the second-largest cryptocurrency by market
                        capitalization, driving the development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and non-fungible
                        tokens (NFTs).

                    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Ethereum is powered by a decentralized network of computers running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM),
                        which executes smart contracts. These smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically
                        enforce the terms of an agreement, enabling applications without a central authority.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Ethereum has also transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS)
                        with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This switch aims to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and
                        increase the networkâ€™s overall efficiency.
